## Wasn't this named "Don't Touch My Birdie"?

I integrated the game with Kik some time after releasing it initially. It got a bit popular there and @austinhallock from Clay.IO noticed. Since then I've been getting advices from him on how to improve the game. The new name and art are parts of the changes we've been trying out.
